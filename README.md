## Meta

This repo contains a hobby project that I originally thought of in early 2017. I had worked through a few iterations of it mainly to get some practice coding. Written in Java because as of right now it's pretty much the only language I'm familiar with.

I'm generating this README with the hopes that others would be able to get an idea of what I'm aiming for and pair with me to build it out.

## Project Description

**_One-sentence goal_**: To build a PIN system (like the kind used on an ATM) that is more secure than the traditional 10-digit PIN system yet still simple enough that an average person can enter their "password" in a reasonable amount of time and without much complication.

This repo contains a hobby project that I originally thought of in early 2017. I had worked through a few iterations of it mainly to get some practice coding. Written in Java because as of right now it's pretty much the only language I'm familiar with.

I'm generating this README with the hopes that others would be able to get an idea of what I'm aiming for and pair with me to build it out.

## Project Description

### **_One-sentence goal_**

To build a PIN system (like the kind used on an ATM) that is more secure than the traditional 10-number pad PIN system, yet still simple enough that an average person can enter their "password" in a reasonable amount of time and without much complication.

### **_What happened?_**

Your name is Alice and you have a bank account, just like many of the other people in your community. You have an ATM card that allows you to access the funds in your account by using any number of ATM machines installed throughout your city. You use these ATM machines by first inserting your ATM card (which the bank knows is associated with your account because of the data encoded in the magnetic strip on the card) and then inputting your 4-digit PIN, which happens to be **7245**. If you'll recall, you decided on that number the day you set up your bank account many years ago. You have also never told anyone this code, and assuming no one at the bank knows it, you understand that the only way a person can access your funds through an ATM is if they both have your ATM card _and also know your private 4-digit PIN_.

Many years go by without incident. There are never any strange transactions showing up on your account transaction history and all withdrawals are ones that you remember authorizing.

One day you hear from your bank that suspicious activity has occurred on your account. After a short investigation the police have discovered that a person got ahold of your card and made an exact copy of it, then slipped the original back into your purse without you knowing. They inserted this copy-card into an ATM and attempted five times to randomly guess your PIN before the ATM destroyed the card and notified the bank of abnormal activity.

Believing that the only copy of your card has been destroyed, you continue life as normal.

Months later you are notified by your bank that your account has been overdrawn by $100. You are certain that you did not authorize this withdrawal. After a slightly longer investigation by the police, it turns out that the original crook had made a second copy of your card, and then only recently installed a hidden camera near the ATM that you frequent most. This camera was set up in such a way to take a clear video of anyone's hands as they typed in their 4-digit PIN onto the pin pad.

Armed with an exact copy of your ATM card _and the knowledge of your supposedly private PIN_, the crook was able to withdraw funds from your account.
